* Get the function as string similar to calculator (CASIO)
* Find the first derivative of the f(x) i.e function
* Now subs the range of the values in the f(x)
* When the symbol changes, then record that values and note it as the range
* Now, add both the ranges, then divide by 2 (i.e) take avg
* now apply the NRM formula, x_n+1 = x_n - (f(x_n)/f'(x_n)); n=0,1,2,3, ... 
* when the value that is being calculator is same, then it means we have found the root
* give the proof that it solves the equation
